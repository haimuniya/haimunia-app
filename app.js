// about where these may and may not be used (never in an attribute, inside
// <textarea>, inside <option>, or inside SVG <text> - those keep bare esc();
// .mono runs keep bare esc() too).
//
// It was promoted there the moment the run-level half landed. Two copies of a
// one-line <bdi> wrapper were a manageable duplication; two copies of a
// run-detection algorithm are not, and the drift failure mode is silent - one
// copy quietly stops isolating and nobody sees a broken string, only a
// plausible wrong workout.
//
// SAFE is src/constants.js's `const SAFE = window.BoxLogSafe`, and
// src/constants.js loads immediately before this file (index.html:1592-1596).

// the reason the paragraph above gives for bidiText. Every `.mono` readout in
// this file goes through it - that class declares `direction:ltr` in
// index.html, which is right for a bare number and wrong the moment a Hebrew
// unit joins it. See the "CONTAINER level" section in safe-helpers.js.
// Two statements, not one `var a = …, b = …`: test/community-module-split.js

// const array, for the same reason fieldMax() below is one: it references
// ICONS, which isn't defined until much later in this file - a function
// body doesn't run until called, well after the whole script has loaded,
// so the forward reference is safe the same way fieldMax's is.
// COMM-327 originally kept `main: true` to the 4 offline training-log tabs
// only, leaving Community as the hamburger-only 5th item - reasoned as
// "Community needs a full-page sub-nav of its own once signed in, not a
// single tap target." Revisited: that reasoning doesn't actually hold once
// you notice the WOD tab already carries its own sub-nav (Log/History/
// Benchmarks) while living in the bottom bar - "has sub-screens" was never
// really disqualifying. Community is now `main: true` too, exactly the
// same footing as WOD: one tap from anywhere, its own on-screen subtabbar
// (cloud.js's `.subtabbar`, `setCommunityTab`) handles Feed/Boards/Coach/
// Account navigation once you're on the tab, same as WOD's own subtabbar
// handles Log/History/Benchmarks. `.tabbtn{flex:1}` (index.html) has no
// hardcoded child count, so a 5th icon costs each ~20% width, nothing more.
// The mobile hamburger's Community row and its `.subnav` preview
// (renderNavRows' onlyOther branch below) naturally stop appearing there
// once this flips - onlyOther now returns nothing to show, and the on-
// screen subtabbar is real Community navigation now, not a fallback for a
// preview that's gone. The desktop sidebar (onlyOther=false) is unaffected,
// since it already showed every item including the preview regardless.

// treatment and which photo/sheet-tone it takes - render() reads this to
// stamp #app[data-scene], and every scene modifier class + photo URL lives
// only in CSS (index.html), never here, so this object never grows past a
// lookup table. Keyed by this app's REAL tab ids (confirmed against
// getNavItems() below), not the spec sample's illustrative names:
// "calendar" is the reference's "History" screen (month grid + day list),
// "history" is the reference's "Progress" screen (already labelled
// "התקדמות" and already the PR/chart tab) - see CHANGES.md for the mapping
// reasoning. "wod" (Library) and Settings are intentionally absent: Library
// gets its own scene once implemented, Settings stays a solid surface per
// IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md §8's own instruction not to immerse it.
// ONLY list a tab here once its render function actually returns the
// .scene-page/.scene-sheet markup. body[data-scene]'s CSS (header goes
// transparent/absolute, brand-stripe hides, bottom bar goes dark) applies
// unconditionally the moment a tab's key is a member of this object -
// registering a tab before its content is restructured breaks that tab's
// EXISTING layout instead of leaving it untouched (found live: registering
// "community" here before Community had scene markup floated its header
// over ordinary dialog content and blocked a real button underneath it -
// community-recap-classmates.mjs's browser-check scenario caught this
// exact failure). Add tabs here in the same commit as their render-function

// (~22 taps of a 2.5 kg stepper from the empty bar). The chips REPLACE the
// table when the club turns the key on - see renderLogTab. Two percentage
// surfaces on one screen, disagreeing about their rounding, is exactly the
// drift this codebase is prone to.

// STRENGTH_PCT_CHIPS is PCT_STEPS' twin and deliberately a superset of it:
// the same 5% ladder, carried down to 50%, because a chip row can hold ten

// argument and there is no member setting to respect. When the key is on, the

// Short, user-facing changelog — deliberately separate from CHANGES.md,
// which is developer-facing, technical, and in English. Only add an entry
// here when something a member would actually notice shipped; not every
// version bump needs one. Same list backs both the auto-shown "what's new"
// popup and the bell icon's persistent history — see openNotifications().
// Everything up to 2.34.0 is the 2.x app's own list, verbatim: it is the
// history members actually saw, and their stored lastSeenVersion ("2.34.0")
// is what makes only the entries above it show on first open.

// A real, user-reported bug: on Chrome/Android, "every time I open the app
// it looks a bit up, then a scroll fixes it" - the bottom tab bar
// specifically, confirmed by the user. Root cause: while a boot-time modal
// (welcome / onboarding / release-notes) is open, document.body.style.overflow
// is "hidden" (each open*() below sets it), which keeps the page unscrollable
// - and Chrome will not collapse its own URL bar while the page can't scroll.
// Closing the modal restores scrollability, but the browser only re-collapses
// its chrome in response to an actual scroll gesture, not automatically. Until
// that happens, #bottomBar/#bottomTabBar (position:fixed; bottom:0) are laid
// out against the taller, stale viewport and sit visibly higher than their
// real resting place - exactly "a bit up" - until the user's own first scroll
// fixes it. A version bump (like this session's) makes this hit almost every
// returning member on their next open, since openNotifications() below is
// what shows them "what's new".
//
// Fix: nudge the browser into recalculating immediately instead of waiting
// for the user. #app's own bottom padding (200px + safe-area-inset-bottom)
// guarantees real scrollable room even on a short tab, so this always has
// somewhere to move. rAF-deferred so it runs after the overflow unlock (and

// ---------- Support and bug reporting ----------
// Added 2026-09-15, straight out of the first real-phone session this app
// ever had. Four things were reported as "not working" that day, and the
// only reason they reached anybody is that the person holding the phone was
// also the person who could fix them. A member has no such channel: the app
// has never had a single route for "this is broken" or "I need help", so
// every one of those reports would have ended as a shrug, or as a message in
// the club WhatsApp group that nobody with the code ever reads.
//
// WHY THIS LIVES IN app.js AND NOT cloud.js. Community is opt-in, and the
// training log works with no account, no network and no Supabase at all. A
// member who never joined Community is exactly as entitled to report a bug as
// one who did - more so, since the offline log is the part they use daily.
// Putting this in cloud.js would have made "can I ask for help" depend on
// having said yes to a social feed.
//
// WHY IT HANDS OFF INSTEAD OF WRITING TO THE DATABASE. Reporting a bug is
// precisely the moment the app might be the broken thing. A table write needs
// a live client, a network, a valid session and an intact RLS path - four
// things a bug report should never be gated on. Composing the text locally
// and handing it to WhatsApp or mail costs none of them, works in airplane
// mode, and leaves the member holding their own copy of what they sent.

// change how the app behaves are what actually narrow a bug down, and every
// one of them is about the DEVICE, not the person. The member can read the

// ---------- First-run sequencing (design spec §1) ----------
//
// THE FINDING. A new member's first load used to stack four surfaces that
// each wanted something before the app had given them anything: the welcome
// sheet (name AND box-start date), the five-screen explainer as a gate, an
// achievement celebration, and the install banner. Two of those carried a
// primary button reading the identical string בואו נתחיל, which is why the
// flow read as "not progressing" rather than as two steps. The stacking half
// of that was fixed in 8afbc57 (one modal queue); this is the SEQUENCE half.
//
// THE RULE, and it is the only rule here: one surface at a time, and nothing
// costs the member anything until the app has given them something. Concretely
// that means each ask is deferred to the moment the member can actually answer
// it from experience rather than on faith:
//
//   name          -> S1, the one blocking sheet, one field, skippable
//   the tour      -> S2, a card on the logging screen, never a gate, and
//                    permanently re-openable from Settings
//   box-start date-> off first run entirely (Settings + the achievements
//                    screen's own prompt card, which is where a member is
//                    actually looking at the tenure badges it unlocks)
//   cloud backup  -> S5, after the first entry exists, because "back up your
//                    workouts" is a meaningless question to someone who has
//                    no workouts
//   install       -> S6, day two, because "keep this app" is a meaningless
//                    question on the first minute of the first day
//
// Everything below is bookkeeping for those five deferrals.

// The calendar date of the very first open. S6 needs it to answer "is this a
// different day from the day they installed", which is not the same question
// as "has time passed" and cannot be reconstructed from the entry log (a
// member can log a set dated last week on their first day).

// prior set of this movement, their own history takes over again), and each
// number sits far above anything anyone in this room lifts rather than at
// what a member "should" — a ceiling that questioned a real athlete's real
// lift would be worse than the typo it caught. Per category, because a

// One non-blocking toast, used for two jobs that are the same shape: the

// on — long enough to read the row you just removed, short enough that it

// that way (see deferCommunityDelete(), cloud.js): the write is HELD for the

// Rx+ is the standard CrossFit answer above Rx: the workout as prescribed and
// then heavier - a competitor's weights, or the movement's harder variant. The
// club asks for it because filing it as plain Rx flattens a real difference in
// effort, and filing it as a separate boolean beside `rx` would make every
// reader of an entry ask two questions to learn one fact.
//
// So it is the SAME field, with a third value: true (Rx), false (Scaled),
// "plus" (Rx+). That shape is what makes it safe to add here. Everything that
// asks `e.rx ?` - the Rx-per-WOD achievements, formatWodEntry's scaled-weight
// suffix, the club comparison key's rx/scaled bucket - reads "plus" as Rx,
// which is what Rx+ is: Rx, and more. Only the places that mean the WORD get
// a third branch, and they all go through wodEffortLabel/wodEffortTag below
// rather than repeating the ternary, because that ternary had five copies and
// this is exactly how the fifth one gets missed.
//
// AT THE CLOUD BOUNDARY IT IS Rx. club_wod_results.rx is a boolean column and
// this branch adds no migration, so the three bridges that cross into cloud.js
// coerce with `!== false`: an Rx+ result publishes to the club board as Rx,
// which is true, rather than as a string the RPC would silently read as Rx

// Design spec §1.2 S2. The five-screen explainer, demoted from a gate to a
// pull. A gate is answered by whoever is in a hurry with a dismissal; a card
// on an otherwise empty screen is answered by whoever actually wants it, and
// it is still there tomorrow for whoever did not.
//
// PLACEMENT NOTE, and it is a deliberate departure from the spec's wording.
// §1.2 S2 says "directly under the page title, above מה עשינו היום?". That
// puts a tour advertisement above the app's primary control on the first
// screen a member ever sees, which is the same mistake the install banner
// makes, one size smaller - and it contradicts the spec's own next sentence,
// which describes this as "the second-most prominent thing after the
// exercise picker". It renders directly BELOW the picker instead: on a
// first-run screen that is otherwise a paragraph of grey text and a large
// void, nothing above the fold competes with it, and the app's whole job
// stays the first thing on the page.
//
// PROMINENCE, revisited. The sentence above ("nothing above the fold
// competes with it") was true only because the picker above it was styled
// as flatly as this card was. Now that the picker reads as the primary
// action it is meant to be, an optional one-minute explainer wearing a
// brass border, a filled surface and a card shadow was the second-loudest
// thing on the screen and out of proportion to what it offers. It keeps its
// place, its copy and its 64px target - only the three accents are gone
// (.tour-offer, index.html).
// THE FIRST OPEN AFTER THE 2.x APP. This edition reads a member's existing
// data where it already is (same database, same keys), and writes a marker
// the first time it has run on a device, so any later migration starts from
// a known edition instead of guessing from which keys happen to exist.
//
// Before that marker exists on a device that already has data, the log
// screen offers one download of everything - the insurance the plan asks for
// against a defect in this upgrade, and the first file the 2.x export could

// applyRemotePrivateRecord(). So attempts sync exactly like every other
// record because they ARE every other record, and nothing here writes
// anything. A `benchmark_attempt` record type would also have needed a
// migration to get past private_records' record_type check constraint
// (202608260001), and supabase/migrations/ is the one directory two open

             The beginner persona read it as the app reporting a fault with
             her PHONE, not as a heading over a control to approach slowly:
             a red warning that fires before she has touched anything is
             indistinguishable from an error message. The heading now names
             what the section DOES, and the red moves off it and stays where
             it belongs - on the .chip-btn.danger control itself, which
             test/audit-ux-fixes.test.mjs pins - so the colour warns about an
             action rather than about the app.
             The rest of the block moved to the same register. It now says
             what actually gets deleted and that clearAllData() downloads a
