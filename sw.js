// HOW AN INSTALLED 2.x PHONE GETS THIS VERSION. The browser re-fetches this
// file on navigation (bypassing the HTTP cache for the script itself), sees
// the bytes changed, and installs this worker alongside the old one. The old
// page's own update flow - reg.onupdatefound -> offerUpdate() -> postMessage
// SKIP_WAITING -> controllerchange -> reload - talks to whatever worker is
// waiting, and this one answers SKIP_WAITING below. Nothing new is needed on
// the old side, which matters because the old side is already on members'
// phones and cannot be changed.
//
// SW_VERSION is written by scripts/sync-version.mjs from APP_VERSION in
// app.js; the cache name carries it, so every release is a fresh cache.

// Everything the app cannot start without. If any of these fails to
// download, install fails and the PREVIOUS version keeps running - the safe
