// `usage` is where src/usage.js sends its anonymous counts: the club's
// Supabase project and its PUBLISHABLE key, which is public by design (it
// only ever acts as the anon role, and anon can do exactly one thing there:
// insert a count into training_log_usage - see that table's migration in
// haimuniya/haimunia-app-demo). Never a service-role or secret key. Remove
// `usage` and counting simply stops; nothing else depends on it.
