# Security & hardening pass — v2.7.0 → v2.8.0

Files changed: `app.js`, `index.html`, `sw.js`. `manifest.json` unchanged.

Verified with two suites run against the real app booted in a DOM
(jsdom + fake-indexeddb): **58 security assertions** and **59 functional
regression assertions**, all passing.

## Critical

### 1. XSS via unescaped HTML attributes
`esc()` was applied to text nodes but skipped on several attribute values.

- `renderStepper()` — `data-field`, `data-action`, `data-step`, `data-min`,
  `value`, and the label are now all escaped. `field` is a user-authored
  movement name from the WOD builder.
- `data-id` on `pick-movement`, `pick-wod`, `select-history`,
  `select-wod-history`, `delete-entry`, `delete-wod-entry`; `data-date` on
  `cal-select-day`.
- `CATEGORY_LABELS[cat] || cat` and `style="background:${CATEGORY_COLORS[cat]}"`
  — replaced with `catLabel()` / `catColor()`, which use `hasOwnProperty` and
  fall back to safe defaults, then escaped.
- The `render()` catch-block printed `err.message` raw into `innerHTML`.

The `id` and `category` sinks were reachable from an imported backup file,
which is the vector that mattered.

### 2. Import accepted arbitrary data
`importDataFromFile()` checked only that `record.id` was truthy.

- Added `sanitizeMovement` / `sanitizeCustomWod` / `sanitizeEntry` /
  `sanitizeWodEntry` / `sanitizeBodyweight`. Each rebuilds the record field by
  field from a whitelist: `cleanId` (charset `A-Za-z0-9._:-`), `cleanStr`
  (control chars stripped, length capped), `cleanNum` (clamped both ends),
  `cleanISODate`, `cleanTs`. Nothing from the file is ever stored as-is.
- `data.app` and `data.version` are now verified (they were written on export
  and ignored on import).
- 25 MB file cap, 20,000-record-per-list cap.
- Confirmation prompt before merging, and a `box-log-rollback-<date>.json`
  auto-backup is downloaded first, since the merge can't be undone in-app.
- Result message reports imported / rejected / failed-to-save counts.
- New `reloadFromDb()` re-sanitizes on every load, so records written by an
  older build of the app can't poison the render path either.

### 3. Prototype pollution → persistent DoS
`byCategory[m.category]` with `category: "__proto__"` resolved to
`Object.prototype`, and `.push` threw a `TypeError`. Because the record was
persisted, the picker crashed on every load until "clear all data".

- `byCategory` and `builderMovements` now use `Object.create(null)` via `bag()`.
- `catColor` / `catLabel` guard lookups with `hasOwnProperty`.
- The category whitelist in the sanitizer closes the entry point.

## Hardening

- **CSP added** to `index.html` — `script-src 'self'`, `object-src 'none'`,
  `base-uri 'none'`, `form-action 'none'`, `connect-src 'self'`.
  `'unsafe-inline'` is in `style-src` only (inline `style=` attributes; there is
  no inline `<script>` anywhere). `frame-ancestors` is in the meta tag but is
  ignored there — **set it as a real response header on the host.**
- `<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">`.
- Google Fonts left in place but documented inline with the exact steps to
  self-host; `preconnect` to `fonts.gstatic.com` was missing and is now added.
  Self-hosting is the one item I couldn't do for you — it needs the woff2 files.

---

## Service worker (rewritten)

- **Origin-gated.** It previously cached every successful GET from any origin,
  forever. Now same-origin only, and only app-shell paths are written back.
- **`Promise.allSettled` over individual `cache.add()`** instead of `addAll()`,
  which failed the entire install on one missing file.
- **Added the maskable icons** to `ASSETS` (referenced in the manifest, absent
  from the precache list).
- **Navigation handling with `ignoreSearch: true`** — this is what makes the
  manifest shortcuts (`./index.html?tab=add`) work offline; exact-URL matching
  missed on the query string.
- **`skipWaiting()` removed from install.** A new worker parks in `waiting`; the
  update banner posts `SKIP_WAITING` and the page reloads on `controllerchange`.
  Previously the new worker took over while the old `app.js` was still running.
- Navigation preload enabled; `SW_VERSION` bumped to 2.8.0 alongside
  `APP_VERSION`.

---

## Smaller fixes

- **Pinch-zoom restored.** `user-scalable=no` / `maximum-scale=1` removed from
  the viewport meta, and the `touchmove` / `gesture*` blockers removed from
  `app.js` (WCAG 1.4.4). The double-tap-zoom suppression is kept, since that one
  fires by accident on the steppers.
- **Numeric inputs bounded at both ends** via `clampField()` — previously only a
  floor. `1e12` in a weight box no longer propagates into app state.
- **`maxlength` on every text input**, plus `cleanStr()` caps in JS (names 80,
  notes 300).
- **IDs now use `crypto.randomUUID()`.** The old slug scheme stripped every
  non-`[a-z0-9]` character, so all Hebrew movement names collapsed to
  `custom--<timestamp>`.
- **`userName` moved from localStorage to IndexedDB** (with one-time migration).
  It's the only PII in the app and "clear all data" never touched it — it does
  now, and the welcome modal reappears. Same for the last-export marker.
- **Storage failures surfaced.** `noteStorageError()` distinguishes
  `QuotaExceededError` and shows it in red in the footer instead of silently
  swallowing it.
- `CSS.escape` via `cssSel()` on the two `querySelector` calls that interpolate
  a field name — these threw on any name containing a quote.
- `openDB()` now memoises its promise instead of reopening the DB per call.
- `URL.revokeObjectURL` deferred 30s so the download reliably starts.
- `mobile-web-app-capable` added next to the deprecated Apple variant.

## Left for you

1. **Self-host the fonts** and tighten the CSP to `font-src 'self'` /
   `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`.
2. **Server response headers**: HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
   `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `Permissions-Policy` denying
   camera/microphone/geolocation/usb, and `frame-ancestors 'none'` as a real
   header.
3. **Automate the version bump** — `APP_VERSION` in `app.js` and `SW_VERSION` in
   `sw.js` are still synced by hand. A missed bump means users stay on stale
   code, which is now a security concern and not just a UX one.
4. Exports are still plaintext JSON containing the name, bodyweight history, and
   full training log. Normal for a backup, but worth a line of UI text next to
   the export button.
